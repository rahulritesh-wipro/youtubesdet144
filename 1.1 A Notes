Automation Framework
We organize project files and folders in structured manner.

Objectives--
--------------
1. Re-usability
2. maintainability
3. Readability

Types of Frameworks
-----------------------
1. Built-in Framework  - testNG, junit,cucumber,robot etc
BDD in java - cucumber
BDD in python - jbehave, pytest
BDD serenity
2. Customized Framework (user-defined) - modular framework, data-driven, keyword-driven, hybrid driven etc

Built-in framework + customized framework = Framework

Every Framework has some common components, 80% is same.
Hybrid is preferred - 3rd party inegrations
Automation Plan
------------------------

Phases / Stages of Automation
1. Analyse the AUT application under test
> No. of pages
> Type of element handles /how & type
> performance of AUT / synchronization issues
> common business flows of AUT
> effort estimation
> mutilple sites and languages
> type of tools
> what we can automate
> what we cannot automate

2. Choose test cases for automation
how - some test cases needs to be tested manually, font, style, images, cosmetics
All manual test cases should be ready before automation
Test data
env
If build is not stable then automation is not possible

Is 100% automation is possible ?
> all automatable test cases should be automated
